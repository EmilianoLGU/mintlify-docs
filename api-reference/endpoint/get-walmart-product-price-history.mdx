### Headers

<ParamField path="x-api-key" type="string" required="false">
  Your unique API key for authentication.

  This key is required in the header of all API requests, to authenticate your account and access Rivin.ai's services. Get your API key through the [**Settings**](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)\*\* page\*\*.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField path="walmart_product_code" type="string" required>
  The (typically) 6-12 digit walmart product code that will be used to search Walmart's catalog.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ParamField path="walmart_product_code" type="string">
  The (typically) 6-12 digit walmart product code.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="price_history" type="string">
  List of price snapshots for the product, including:

  - **date** _(string, ISO 8601)_ – The date/time the price was recorded.
  - **price** _(number)_ – The listed buybox price at that time in the local currency (default USD)
</ParamField>

<Note>
  This api/walmart/product/price-history endpoint **only tracks the Walmart buybox price and time** — not prices for each individual seller on a listing.

  [Rivin.ai](http://Rivin.ai) **periodically pulls prices for different products** depending on their **monthly sales volume**, with high-volume products tracked more frequently.

  If you need to **guarantee tracking** of a specific product (including prices per seller, inventory in stock per seller, and sales captured per seller), use our **/api/walmart/oversight** endpoints instead.
