Build powerful e-commerce applications with [Rivin.ai](http://Rivin.ai)'s comprehensive Walmart product data API. Access both real-time and historical product information, pricing, reviews, and more to enhance your applications and provide better experiences for your users.

## **Getting Started**

### **Authentication**

All API requests require authentication using your API key. Include your key in the x-api-key header with every request:

<RequestExample>

```x-api-key Proper Authentication Example
curl -X GET "https://api.rivin.ai/walmart/product?upc=040094535309" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

</RequestExample>

## **Credit System**

[Rivin.ai](http://Rivin.ai) uses a credit-based pricing model to ensure fair usage and cost-effective access to our data:

- **Basic API requests** (product lookup, basic data): **1 credit**
- **Complex queries** (price history, units sold history, profitability analysis): **up to 25 credits**

Credits are consumed based on the complexity and depth of data requested. Monitor your credit usage in your dashboard and purchase additional credits as needed.

## **Rate Limits**

Rate limits vary by endpoint and are designed to ensure optimal performance for all users:

- **Real-time data lookup**: Lower rate limits for real-time queries
- **Historical data analysis**: Higher rate limits due to pulling this data directly from our own databases

**Customizable Limits**: Rate limits are fully adjustable based on your specific use case and requirements. [Contact our team](https://cal.com/rivin-ai/30min) to discuss custom rate limit configurations for high-volume applications or enterprise needs. We are happy to increase rate limits in order to meet your needs.
